# Audio Integration and Bug Fixes

## Audio System Integration
- Added AudioManager integration with proper error handling
- Connected sound effects to game events:
  - Snowball throwing
  - Snowball hits
  - Player/enemy damage
  - Freeze events
  - Footstep sounds
- Added background music for game and menu

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed null reference errors in guy.gd and red_guy.gd
- Added proper null checks for:
  - Temperature system variables
  - Throw timers
  - Movement variables
  - AudioManager resources
- Protected warmth_percentage calculations from division by zero
- Added default value initialization for all exported variables
- Made error handling more robust throughout the code

## Known Issues
- SFX files are still placeholders - need to add actual sound effect files
- Enemy movement sometimes gets stuck near boundaries
- Warmth UI may need further refinement

## Next Steps
- Add actual sound effect files
- Fine-tune audio volume levels
- Add more visual feedback for hits and freeze events
